      sat on the bench in the dormitory, and everyone seemed to be sleeping well\u2014except
      for him. He never sleeps. I'm going to try looking for his medicine in his
      nightstand. I lost the key again. I think it was left inside the dormitory
      when his nightstand fell over as he tried to attack me. But the door shut,
      and no matter how many times I told the boss, I still haven\u2019t gotten the
      spare key. I just hope he doesn\u2019t find it\u2026 or we\u2019re doomed."

      insane and who we've placed in a facility with other insane people to get better,
      but afterward we'll have some ice cream by the statue.\u201D But well, it's
      for the better. They need to see that their families haven't forgotten or abandoned
      them. That would only make things worse..."

      look in his eyes, staring out the window. I still remember when he arrived\u2014he
      was the most sociable one. But he got worse\u2026 more than he already was.
      He spent a few days in the hospital, and when he came back, he wasn\u2019t
      the same. I don't know what happened, but his family never returned. I decided
      to take him to the movies, since in those moments he seems happy. But I never
      trust it completely, because at night he doesn't seem to remember those moments..."

      I don\u2019t even remember their voice anymore. But they always show up. I\u2019m
      not sure if they even understand anything.\nI got my degree years ago. Besides,
      they assume that because I studied Biomedical Engineering, I can teach every
      subject. If only they knew I cheated on every History exam, they wouldn\u2019t
      rely on me\u2026"

      plenty of rooms, five bathrooms, and even a cinema, so I can\u2019t really
      complain.\nHe speaks now, but I\u2019d rather not listen. He made them all
      disappear, because he\u2019s very jealous\u2014and I don\u2019t like that.\nNow
      I love spending the nights here. It feels good inside. It\u2019s cold, though,
      because no one pays for electricity, water, or gas\u2026"

      bodies were found throughout the building. The only person unaccounted for
      is a schizophrenic patient, a 40\u201350-year-old former biomedical engineer,
      who was institutionalized after attempting to kill his ex-partner, claiming
      someone from the future told him to do it. Authorities believe he is still
      hiding inside, so the building has been sealed off except for the main entrance,
      which is under constant surveillance while police urge him to surrender."
